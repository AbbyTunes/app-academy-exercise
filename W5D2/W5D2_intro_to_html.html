    <h1>Recipe for Ants Climbing A Tree</h1>

    <h2>Ants Climbing a Tree (蚂蚁上树) is a classic Szechuan dish in Chinese cuisine. It is so called because the bits of ground
    meat clinging to the noodles evoke an image of ants walking on twigs. This dish is made from mung bean noodles, also
    know as Chinese glass vermicelli. These thin noodles become soft and translucent after soaking in water.</h2>
